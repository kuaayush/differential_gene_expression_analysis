# Comparative Analysis of Differential Gene Expression in HNSC and CESC

This repository contains code, plots, and documentation from a self-initiated project exploring differential gene expression between **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC)** and **Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (CESC)** using bulk RNA-seq data from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to identify **shared and distinct gene expression signatures** between two HPV-driven cancers â€” HNSC and CESC â€” and uncover **biological pathways and processes** that distinguish them using differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) and functional enrichment analysis.

## ðŸ§¬ Objective

* Compare bulk RNA-seq profiles of HNSC and CESC from TCGA.
* Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
* Perform **Principal Component Analysis**, generate **MA plots**, **Volcano plots**, **Gene Ontology (GO)**, and **Pathway Enrichment Analysis** to interpret biological relevance.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

* **Source**: TCGA (downloaded via `TCGAbiolinks` in R)
* **Type**: Bulk RNA-seq
* **Samples**: Tumor tissues from HNSC and CESC patients
* **Notes**: Bulk RNA-seq provides an average expression profile across all cells in a sample, making it suitable for identifying dominant transcriptional trends.

## ðŸ§  Biological Insights

Even though both cancers are associated with **HPV**, they manifest in distinct anatomical regions and contexts. By comparing their transcriptomes:

* PCA revealed initial clustering by sequencing depth (PC1), corrected by normalization.
* Post-normalization PCA revealed clear separation by cancer type, indicating distinct expression profiles.
* DEGs were identified using DESeq2 and analyzed for biological significance.
* Enrichment analyses highlighted **cancer-specific pathways** and **biological processes**.

All generated plots including PCA, MA plots, volcano plots, heatmaps, GO and pathway enrichment results are provided in the [**Figures**](./figures) folder.
